participant

Two college participants 
Participant 1 (in research group)
Participant 2 (not in research group) 
(height: 1.79 ± .11 m; mass: 83.36kg ± 20.16kg)
Two vertical jumps for each participant
First one: cued by “Jump as high as possible” (AHAP)
Second one: cue by “Jump as fast as possible” (AFAP)


method:

100 Hz by a 8-camera optical motion capture system 
(Theia 3D, Theia Markerless Inc., Kingston, ON )
1200 Hz by  1 force plate 
(Bertec Corp.; Columbus, OH, USA )

Data processes:
Filter data: 4th zero lag Butterworth low pass filtering 
cutoff frequency = 6Hz for motion data / 20Hz for force plate data 
Calculate knee flexion / extension angle following the previous homework
    (relative angles)
Calculate knee angular velocity with angle respect by the time interval 
Calculate jump height by impulse method 
Calculate impulse by integral
Normalized ground reaction force (GRF) and impulse by body weight (BW)
